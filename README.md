# 📊 Student Performance Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a real-world student performance dataset using Python.  
The main goal is to explore, clean, and analyze the data in order to discover meaningful patterns and insights related to students’ academic performance.

The analysis follows a complete data analysis pipeline including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and interpretation of results.

## 🧠 Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To understand the structure and quality of the dataset
- To clean missing and inconsistent data
- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- To visualize relationships between variables
- To draw meaningful conclusions from the data

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation
The following preprocessing steps were applied:
- Identification of missing values across all columns
- Replacement of missing numerical values using the column mean
- Replacement of missing categorical values using the most frequent category (mode)
- Removal of duplicate records to ensure data quality

These steps ensure the dataset is reliable and suitable for analysis.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Univariate Analysis
- Histograms were used to visualize the distribution of numerical features.
- Bar charts were used to analyze categorical variables.

### Bivariate Analysis
- A scatter plot was used to study the relationship between study hours and final exam scores.
- A box plot was used to compare exam score distributions between genders.

These visualizations help identify patterns, trends, and potential relationships within the dataset.

## 📈 Key Findings
- Students who spend more time studying tend to achieve higher final exam scores.
- There are observable differences in performance across gender groups.
- Most variables show reasonable distributions with limited outliers.
- The dataset is clean and suitable for further statistical or machine learning analysis.
